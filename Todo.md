-[x] Show element in hierarchy
-[x] Highlight code inside a file
-[x] Show a File AST View
-[x] Style improvements, make code entities selectable and navigable with a side panel. #style
-[x] Functions/methods: num of lines, arguments, depth/nesting #functions
-[x] Code metrics are generated on search //https://react-google-charts.com/ #charts
-[x] Add support for Javascript #languageSupport
-[x] Make > to be more consistent with the css gramatic #search
-[x] Select by name #search
-[x] Support unquoted integers
-[x] Add selector like . for name #search
-[x] Simplify/unify common types like fun, class file round #1 etc #search
    fun, argument, class, call, import,  binding (var, val etc)   
-[x] Simplify/unify trees (JS)
    -[x] class: membersCount, propertiesCount, methodsCount, constructorsCount.
    -[x] file: name, lines, functionsCount, classesCount, bidingsCount
    -[x] fun: paramsCount, lines    
    -[x] call: startsWith, args, arg, argsCount 
-[x] Simplify/unify trees (Kotlin)
    -[x] class: members, properties, methods, constructors.
    -[x] file: name, fileName, lines, functionsCount, classesCount, bidingsCount
    -[x] fun: paramsCount, lines    
    -[x] call: startsWith, args, arg, argsCount   
-[x] Add  Root element selector #search
-[x] JS Parser is too slow, probably because of the process up time for each file, Files can be grouped by folder #optimization
-[x] Code "Starting with" search #search 
-[ ] Add history of a file node #evolution
     We want to see if the code got better or worst in between commits
     -[x] Core support
     -[x] UI
-[x] Basic sintax highlighting
-[x] Performance experience for History
-[ ] Evolution Metrics, see detals of the commits and code that are affecting the metrics
-[ ] Integrate code charts with search Results: Right now when you select boxes in the chart nothing happens, 
       Instead the relevant code entities should be listed
-[ ] When you select a frequency box it should show the selected functions
-[ ] Add Rules/Threshold #evolution
-[ ] Unequality selectors #search fun
-[ ] Preset Clean Code queries: File Total Size, Function parameters, function sizes.
-[ ] Fowler Smells #Smells
-[ ] Reload button
-[ ] Slots/Buckets for charts #charts
-[ ] Duplicated code #metrics
-[ ] Error Handling: Good error messages for broken files
-[ ] On packages, see Dependencies etc #cleanCode
-[ ] Aggregators on the search language (count, sum)
-[ ] Spin loaders for > 1s operations


IceBox:

-[ ] Problems with comments parsing in Kotlin
-[ ] Simplify/unify tree types (JS/KT) #2 #search
     -[ ] loops: for, while, common functional loops 
     -[ ] cond: if, elvis, tri-unary, functional conditions
-[ ] Select other nodes than the leaf: 
    Example if I do a query "a b c"  I should be able to retrieve the nodes that matched a, b and c #search
-[ ] Support multiple 'class search' example fun#helloWorld
-[ ] Support 'kind' search, example: .fun.inline (A function that has class inline)  #search 
-[ ] File search should not expand when is not neccesary. (Optimize searcher) #search    
-[ ] Simplify parser into execution mode instead of data structure mode?
-[ ] Make searchs like fun#myFunction possible (Multi Kinds) #search
-[ ] Stable ID's for functions and classes so that trees can be reconstructed more optimally
-[ ] Command line for Queries and Stats
-[ ] Query items showin in the Graph #charts
-[ ] Branching #metrics
-[ ] Cyclomatic Complexity #metrics
-[ ] On classes... #cleanCode
-[ ] Naming and Semantics
-[ ] Linguistic Similarity
-[ ] Improve AST View (Side pannel with more info)
-[ ] Better highlighting: when a code entity is selected it should highlight in the code
-[ ] Improve navigation: make mouse pointer selection compatible with search results highlights
-[ ] Make on Hover noticeable.
-[ ] Modularization
-[ ] IntelliJ plugin
-[ ] Integration with lint tools and code coverage
-[ ] It should be "easy" for users to add new metrics to nodes
-[ ] Fuzzy/Content Search
-[ ] Refresh single node, Instead of reload everything for evolutionary metrics #optimization
-[ ] Kotlin, add name as a node so it's easy to extract
-[ ] Add References navigator (How classes, types files relate to each other) #charts
