    -[x] call: startsWith, args, arg, argsCount 
-[x] Simplify/unify trees (Kotlin)
    -[x] class: members, properties, methods, constructors.
    -[x] file: name, fileName, lines, functionsCount, classesCount, bidingsCount
    -[x] fun: paramsCount, lines    
    -[x] call: startsWith, args, arg, argsCount   
-[x] Add  Root element selector #search
-[x] JS Parser is too slow, probably because of the process up time for each file, Files can be grouped by folder #optimization
-[x] Code "Starting with" search #search 
-[x] Add history of a file node #evolution
     We want to see if the code got better or worst in between commits
     -[x] Core support
     -[x] UI
-[x] Basic sintax highlighting
-[x] Performance experience for History
-[x] Unequality selectors #search fun
-[x] Aggregators on the search language (count, sum)
-[x] Support aliasing #language
-[x] Support double #language
-[x] Support parenthesys grouping #language
-[x] Add commit metrics
-[ ] UX Consistency
    -[ ] Smells should show more information
    -[x] When selecting a result from charts it should take you to the Result list
    -[x] Evolution Tabs don't make sense where they are 
    -[x] When selecting a node inside a file it should not jump bad
-[x] Either use sampling or smarter code saving (It could go up really quickly)
-[x] Params select should make sense
-[x] Mean, Media, Max, min for charts: Using percentiles.  
-[ ] Graph visualisation (The JSON as it is?)  
-[ ] Relate file nodes by dependencies for the visualization graph
-[ ] Add/Edit Smells/Rules
-[ ] Config and setup (Load a new project etc)
-[ ] Is my commit making things worse?
-[ ] Helper or documentation of existing PseudElements and SelectorFunctions
-[ ] Commit extract user story or bug an attribute
-[ ] Reload button
-[ ] add Protected attributes in the "as" command
-[ ] Pagination/Limit results 
-[ ] Nice snipets on the result list depending on the node type
-[ ] Should be easy to add new graphs, idea have a table function like "fun | asTable('x', 'y')"
-[ ] Charts should be more talkative
-[ ] Search information
 
-[ ] Bug with classes highlighting
-[ ] Slots/Buckets for charts #charts
-[ ] Baseline
-[ ] It should be possible to load a single folder or a single file, right now it is very repository dependent
-[ ] Should we separate runTimeData from vertice data? (Right now you can fuck the state of the graph really bad!)
-[ ] Progress bar when loading history etc, maybe just an indexer with status
-[ ] Commit component (To show associated files and folders)
-[ ] Memory control (Register how many Ram is being used by the cache etc)
-[ ] Reliability: When db is down the app should keep working
-[ ] Error Handling: Good error messages for broken files, errors when loading the graphs
-[ ] Optimize searchs? constraint by type query? limit results? index common queries? load metrics dinamically?


IceBox:
-[ ] Cyclomatic Complexity #metrics (use https://github.com/escomplex/)
-[ ] Replace H2 by file cache?
-[ ] Duplicated code #metrics
-[ ] Use concurrent queue + blocking loadCommit so that commit preloading can give priority to user requested commits
-[ ] Evolution Metrics, see details of the commits and code that are affecting the metrics
-[ ] Problems with comments parsing in Kotlin
-[ ] Simplify/unify tree types (JS/KT) #2 #search
     -[ ] loops: for, while, common functional loops 
     -[ ] cond: if, elvis, tri-unary, functional conditions
-[ ] Select other nodes than the leaf: 
    Example if I do a query "a b c"  I should be able to retrieve the nodes that matched a, b and c #search
-[ ] Support multiple 'class search' example fun#helloWorld
-[ ] Support 'kind' search, example: .fun.inline (A function that has class inline)  #search 
-[ ] File search should not expand when is not neccesary. (Optimize searcher) #search    
-[ ] Simplify parser into execution mode instead of data structure mode?
-[ ] Make searchs like fun#myFunction possible (Multi Kinds) #search
-[ ] Stable ID's for functions and classes so that trees can be reconstructed more optimally
-[ ] Command line for Queries and Stats
-[ ] Query items showin in the Graph #charts
-[ ] Branching #metrics
-[ ] Amount of changes #metrics
-[ ] On classes... #cleanCode
-[ ] Naming and Semantics
-[ ] Linguistic Similarity
-[ ] Improve AST View (Side pannel with more info)
-[ ] Better highlighting: when a code entity is selected it should highlight in the code
-[ ] Improve navigation: make mouse pointer selection compatible with search results highlights
-[ ] Make on Hover noticeable.
-[ ] Modularization
-[ ] IntelliJ plugin
-[ ] Integration with lint tools and code coverage
-[ ] It should be "easy" for users to add new metrics to nodes
-[ ] Fuzzy/Content Search
-[ ] Refresh single node, Instead of reload everything for evolutionary metrics #optimization
-[ ] Kotlin, add name as a node so it's easy to extract
-[ ] Add References navigator (How classes, types files relate to each other) #charts
-[ ] Find and replace
